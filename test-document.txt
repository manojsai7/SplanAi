This is a test document for SplanAI.

SplanAI is a document analysis application that uses Google Cloud Vision for OCR and OpenAI for generating summaries, flashcards, and quizzes.

The application connects to MongoDB Atlas for data storage and uses both Google Cloud Vision and OpenAI APIs for document processing.

Key features include:
1. Document upload and text extraction
2. AI-powered summary generation
3. Flashcard creation
4. Quiz generation
5. Chat interface for document-related questions

This test document is being used to verify that the file upload and processing functionality is working correctly after fixing JSON parsing errors and improving error handling in the application.
